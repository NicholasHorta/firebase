Angular Material dialog

Popup modal that allows passing of data in and out 
Common to have a lot of different dialogs 

We'll be placing all of our dialogs in a single directory - dialogs

The options added to generate them in a specific way

--flat : Generated WITHOUT a directory
--entry-component : Adds it to the entry components array in the ng-module 
-s : Inline Stylesheet
-t : Inline Template
